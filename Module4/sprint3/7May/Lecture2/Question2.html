<!-- Introduction to the Concepts 
Start with an introduction to the terms Authentication and Authorization.
Briefly explain that while they are related concepts in security, they serve different purposes.

2. What is Authentication?
Definition: Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity.
Example: Explaining the process of entering a username and password to log in to a website.

Types of Authentication:
Password-based: Simple login credentials.
Two-factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security.
Biometric Authentication: Fingerprints, Face ID, etc.

3. What is Authorization? 
Definition: Authorization is the process of granting a user access to certain resources or actions.
Example: After logging in (authentication), the system checks if the user has permission to access certain pages or
perform certain actions, like admin privileges.
Example Scenarios:
A user might be authenticated but only authorized to view their own profile, not edit others' profiles.
An admin user has access to a wider range of features compared to a regular user.

4. Key Differences between Authentication and Authorization (2 mins)
Authentication: Verifies who you are.
Authorization: Determines what you can do.
Authentication happens first, followed by authorization.
Example:
Authentication: You log in with your email and password.
Authorization: The system checks if you're allowed to access the admin panel or view certain documents.

5. Real-World Example 
Example: A company with an internal system.
Authentication: Employees log in using company credentials.
Authorization: Employees can access their own records, managers have access to additional resources like financial
reports, etc.

6. Conclusion 
Recap the main points: Authentication and Authorization are different but often used together in securing applications.
