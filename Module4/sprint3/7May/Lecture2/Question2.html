# Authentication vs Authorization

## Introduction
In this document, we will explore the concepts of **Authentication** and **Authorization**. While these two terms are
closely related in security, they serve different purposes. Both are crucial for securing applications and protecting
sensitive data.

## 1. What is Authentication?
**Authentication** is the process of verifying a user's identity to ensure they are who they say they are.

### Example:
- When you log in to a website, you enter a **username** and **password**. The system checks whether these credentials
match what is stored, and if they do, it verifies your identity.

### Types of Authentication:
- **Password-based**: The most common form, where users enter a username and password.
- **Two-factor Authentication (2FA)**: A second layer of security, such as a code sent via SMS or generated by an
authenticator app, in addition to the password.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Uses physical traits, like fingerprints or Face ID, to verify a user.

## 2. What is Authorization?
**Authorization** is the process of granting a user permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions
within an application.

### Example:
- After successfully logging in (authentication), the system checks if the user has permission to view a specific page
or perform an action, like editing a profile or accessing the admin panel.

### Example Scenarios:
- **User**: A regular user might only be authorized to view their own profile, but not edit others' profiles.
- **Admin**: An admin user might have the ability to view and edit all users' profiles, manage resources, or access
system settings.

## 3. Key Differences between Authentication and Authorization

| **Aspect** | **Authentication** | **Authorization** |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Verifies who you are. | Determines what you can do. |
| **Occurs** | Happens first (before authorization). | Happens after authentication. |
| **Example** | You log in with your email and password. | The system checks if you can access the admin panel. |

### Example:
- **Authentication**: You enter your username and password to log in.
- **Authorization**: The system checks if you have permission to view or edit certain documents or pages (like the admin
dashboard).

## 4. Real-World Example

**Scenario**: A company with an internal system.

- **Authentication**: Employees log in using their company credentials (username and password).
- **Authorization**: Once authenticated, employees can access their own records, while managers have additional access
to resources like financial reports.

## 5. Conclusion
To recap:
- **Authentication** and **Authorization** are closely related but serve different roles.
- Authentication verifies the identity of users, while authorization defines what they are allowed to do after they are
authenticated.
- Together, these two concepts help secure applications and protect sensitive data.
